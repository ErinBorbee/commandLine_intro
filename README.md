[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ErinBorbee/commandLine_intro/HEAD)
In this tutorial you will learn about basic commands in your terminal to help you get comfortable navigating your file system from command line. The commands used in this tutorial include:
 - Change directory (`cd`)
 - List contents of directory (`ls`)
 - Make directory (`mkdir`)
 - Move/rename files (`mv`)
 - Remove files/directory (`rm`)
 - Copy file/directory (`cp`) -> and more!

This tutorial was built in a Jupyter Notebook and can be accessed by clicking the "Launch Binder" button at the top of the page. The binder will take a few minutes to launch. Once launched open the file titled "commandLine_intro.ipynb". This will open a Jupyter Notebook with interactive code. The code provided in this notebook should run using files already found in the main repository so there is no need to run the code locally on your own computer.
