    "Command line is a powerful way to navigate and create files and directories. Here, I overview basic commands for navigating unix/linux systems from command line interface (CLI) as opposed to graphical user interfaces (GUIs). This tutorial has been built in a Jupyter notebook using a bash kernel. The commands can be run directly in this notebook by pressing the play button (sideways triangle) at the top of the page, or by clicking \"run selected cells\" under the run menu, or by pressing `CTRL` + `ENTER` for the selected cell."

    "The `rm` command can also be used with wild cards just as we went over in previous commands. And, just as with previous commands, the `rm` command can be used with flags. One of the most useful flags with the `rm` command is the `-r` flag, which allows you to remove entire directories. Just as above with the `ls` command, we use flags with the `rm` command in the format `rm [flags] [file_or_directory_name]`. The command below uses the `-r` flag to delete the `data1` directory from the `exampleData` directory."

    "The commands outlined in this tutorial were all interactive and can be run directly in this notebook. However, there are some commands that are particularly important for those of you who work in command line on remote servers. These commands include `ssh`, `scp`, and more that cannot be run interactively in this notebook format. For those interested in learning commands like that, please feel free to read through the additional Jupyter Notebook file located in this repository called `commandLine_intro_continued.ipynb`."
