    "# Introduction to command line\n",
    "Command line is a powerful way to navigate and create files and directories on your computing system. Here I aim to overview basic commands for navigating unix/linux systems from command line as opposed to using graphical user interfaces (GUIs). This tutorial has been built in a Jupyter notebook using a bash kernel. The commands can either be run within this notebook, or can be copied and pasted into your own terminal window."

    "Navigating directories in command line is a quick way to access your files and is important for being able to keep your file systems organized. The usage of the `cd` command is `cd [filepath]`. But before we can jump into the code itself, we must first go over the difference between absolute and relative filepaths. \n",

If you are unsure of what your home directory is, try typing the `cd` command with no filepath. This will take you to your home directory. To find the filepath for your home directory once there, we can use the `pwd` command which tells the computer to print working directory."
