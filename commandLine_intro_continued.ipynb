    "# Command Line Intro Continued - Working on a remote server\n",
    "Often, high-throughput sequencing data is too large to work with on your local computer. Instead, we store and work with our sequences on a remote server, which requires us to know how to log in remotely, transfer files between our local computer and the remote server, and submit jobs on the server. In this portion of the tutorial, I provide overview of commands that allow us to do all of those tasks on the Texas State University LEAP High Computing Performance Cluster. Because the commands provided are to be used on a remote server, this tutorial is not designed to be interactive but rather to provide overview of the commands and what they do.\n",
    "\n",

    "The commands covered in this tutorial include:\n",
    "\n",
    "secure connect - `ssh`\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing/editing scripts - `nano`, `vi`\n",
    "\n",
    "secure copy - `scp`\n",

    "### Secure connect - `ssh`\n",
    "The `ssh` command allows you to remote log in to a server or computer from any command line terminal. The usage for the command is as follows: `ssh username@serverAddress`. The username will be specific to you and in the case of the LEAP server at Texas State, your username will be your NetID. The server address tells the command what system you are logging into. In the case of the LEAP server, the address will be `leap.txstate.edu`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are logging into another computer the username will be the user account you are logging into on the computer, and the server address will be the IP address for that computer. On Macs the IP address can be found under `System Preferences > Sharing > Remote Login` (note: Remote Login must be checked in order for the `ssh` command to work). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have run the `ssh` command with your user name and server address, you will be prompted to enter your password. For the LEAP server at Texas State, your password will be the same password as you single sign on (the password you use for canvas, outlook, SAP portal, etc.). Your pasword will not appear as you type it so once you have finished typing, press enter, and you should be logged in. An example of this code is provided below."

From here you can use all of the commands overviewed in the first part of the tutorial to create, delete, and navigate directories."

For example, `CTRL` + `X` is to exit the editor and `CTRL` + `O` is to save the file and exit the editor. In `vi`, on the other hand, you must first exit the insert mode (what you entered by pressing `i`) by pressing the `esc` key, and the type `:` followed by the letters associated with the option you need. For example, to exit the editor you would type `esc` followed by `:q` for quit, and to save your document and exit the editor you would type `esc` followed by `:wq` for write and quit.\n",

Where the two editors differ is that `vi` offers more flexibilty when outside of the insert mode. Outside of the insert mode, `vi` allows you to use the up and down arrows to scroll through different lines of the script, and allows you to delete entire lines by pressing `D` twice."

    "### Submit job - `sbatch`\n",
    "When working on a server, you must run your scripts by submitting a job. The job manager assigns jobs to different nodes on the server and allows it to work efficiently. The main node (the node you are working on when you first log in) is fine for organizing you file systems using commands covered in the previous part of the tutorial, but scripts and commands that are more computationally heavy will slow down the server for all users if run on the main node. Therefore it is best practice to submit your scripts to the job manager. To do this, we use the `sbatch` command. This command takes the format `sbatch script.sh`. It is also important to include parameters at the beginning of your script for the job, including maximum time limit, required memory, email contact for when the job is finished and more. An example of these parameters is included below.\n",
